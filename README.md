# **Overview**
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to answer Vietnamese legal questions related to traffic laws. It leverages the power of large language models (LLMs) in combination with an efficient hybrid retrieval mechanism, enabling the system to provide accurate, explainable, and citation-backed answers grounded in legal documents.

# **Data Collection**
The data used in this project consists of Vietnamese legal documents related to road traffic laws, sourced from official government portals and legal repositories. These documents provide the foundation for retrieval-augmented answers and are carefully processed to ensure high quality and relevance.
